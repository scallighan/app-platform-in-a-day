# Azure Kubernetes Service | Considerations
*— I want to run containerized workloads at scale, I need a container orchestration platform that is customizable and gives me autonomy. My team can self-support the cluster and any opensource project we intend to use.*

What for: Deploy and manage containerized applications with a fully managed Kubernetes service.

Who: Teams looking to build directly on the open-source Kubernetes platform, with direct access to the underlying Kubernetes APIs, consistency with multi-cloud and hybrid scenarios, and a single platform to run all workloads , workloads with hyperscale or controlled scheduling, flexible and high resource requirements.

Why: Kubernetes is the core of cloud native community and patterns. Workloads that run on AKS have the flexibility of Kubernetes including portability and extensibility on a managed platform, allowing a focus on the workload without compromising flexibility
