* SDK support for most major languages allow consuming and emitting data easier (C#, F#, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, PowerShell, Python, Go, Rust, and more)
* Create state machines or stateful sagas through Durable Function orchestrators
* Support for many deployment methods: git,Â zipped artifacts, custom containers, and more
* Visual Studio/VS Code integration for creating/deploying/debugging
* Implement business logic into readily available "blocks of code". Worry less about integrations and infrastructure
