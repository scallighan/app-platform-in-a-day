# Azure Functions | Considerations
*— I have event driven microservices that need to be scalable and resilient. I want to focus on writing less code, maintain less infrastructure, and have seamless integration with Azure services.*

What for:  Web APIs, event processing, etc.

Who:  Teams building event driven microservices 

Why:  Worry less about the compute infrastructure, scaling, and dependencies. Focus more on writing the business logic that solve business problems. Easily manage complex business orchestrations. Scale up and down with demand. 

Customer journey:  Azure Functions are the optimal solution for Cloud Native, event-driven microservices.
