# Azure Red Hat OpenShift | Considerations
*— I want to run containerized workloads in a fully managed PaaS based on Kubernetes platform that integrates with other Red Hat products and provides support for compatible Opensource projects.*

*— I am an existing OpenShift customer looking to extend my footprint into the Cloud as part of a hybrid or multi-Cloud strategy.*

What for: Red Hat microservice frameworks

Who: Teams that would benefit from the guard rails and development experience provided by Red Hat OpenShift or are committed to the Red Hat ecosystem

Why: Many customers approach Azure with existing history or preference for specific high-value workloads. Azure Red Hat OpenShift is one such ecosystem and workload.

Customer journey: apps are portable between on-prem installations of Red Hat OpenShift, AWS Red Hat OpenShift and apps built for Red Hat Enterprise Linux
