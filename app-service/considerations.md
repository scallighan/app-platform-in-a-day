# Azure App Service | Considerations
*— I have a web application resembling monolithic; I just want to run it and not manage any infrastructure.*

What for: Web applications, API backends, and mobile backends.

Who: Teams building web applications. They are less concerned with underlying infrastructure, but want the resiliency, security, and manageability that Azure provides.

Why: Websites and Web APIs are an extremely common workload (host a WordPress site, Angular site, etc.). While other hosting options (VMs, AKS, Container Apps) can host websites, App Service is fully focused on web hosting scenarios and provides a managed experience.

Customer journey: App Services is the optimal starting point for web-based applications.
