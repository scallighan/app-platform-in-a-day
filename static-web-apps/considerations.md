# Static Web Apps | Considerations
*— I have a static frontend web app built using frameworks such as Angular, React, Svelte, Vue, or Blazor. I want to deploy this app with serverless APIs as the backend.*

What for:  static frontend Web Apps with serverless APIs

Who:  Developers building public facing web applications

Why:  A serverless approach with auto scaling keep costs low by matching resources to demand. Platform and tools provide a developer workflow that enables high productivity through a tailored local development experience, CI/CD workflows, and preview environments

Customer journey:  Static Web Apps provide a low barrier to host frontend web applications. It is the optimal solution to fully manage a web app with a serverless backend.
