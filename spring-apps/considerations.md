*— I have Spring boot applications; I want to deploy them and I don't have capacity to manage Kubernetes or a containerization process*

Who:  Teams that are committed to Java Spring​ or ASP.NET Core Steeltoe

Why:  Many customers approach Azure with existing history or preference for specific high-value workloads. Spring is one such ecosystem and workload. This provides a seamless managed experience to utilize those investments in Azure.​

Customer journey:  Apps are portable between on-prem installations of Java Spring from any platform (Ex. Virtual Machines, Tomcat, JBoss EAP, Cloud Foundry, other clouds)
